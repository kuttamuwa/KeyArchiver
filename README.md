# KeyArchiver

## Why do we need this?
Do you work with many passwords and you can't remember them sometimes?
Do you have many configs for your app server and your remote machines?
Do you face with some important informations while doing your job but you don't have time 
and architecture to save and find them?

Use KeyArchiver !

## For whom?
Honestly, it aims for developers till stable version. However if we succeeded to create good UI 
for end users, you can use it too. We'd need to encapsulate many details from you to set the config
via gui.

## How do we use it?
Copy any text and press 'ctrl' button for three times and you'll see a keyword pop up.
Type keys to find that text later and press enter. That's it. 

It will store them into database which can be configured via config.

## What about the repo right now? 
This repo is not finished. So you can watch it until stable version. I will finish
whenever I take some free time.
